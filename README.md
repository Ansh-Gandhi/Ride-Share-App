# Ride Share Mobile App

- Developed a full-stack ride-sharing application that allows users to search destinations, request rides, view routes, and process payments in real time

- Designed an intuitive and mobile-optimized interface using **React Native (Expo)**, delivering smooth navigation, onboarding flows, and map-based interaction from **Google Cloud APis**

- Integrated **Clerk** for secure user authentication with methods such as email verification codes and **OAuth**, enabling smooth sign-up and login flows with providers like Google

- Implemented a backend powered by **NeonDB (Postgres)** and **Expo API** routes to manage ride requests, user data, and real-time location updates with consistent reliability

- Added **Stripe** to process ride payments securely, completing the end-to-end booking flow from route selection to payment confirmation
